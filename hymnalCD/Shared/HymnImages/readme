Naming Conventions For Hymns and Hymn Folders
-----
Folders in this directory each represent a hymn.  I think it makes sense to have a flatter directory structure with one folder name AAA### for each hymn.  
Letter Codes should be as follows. 
STJ - Sing the Journey
HWB - Hymnal: a Worship Book
STS - Sing the Story
Number Codes should be listed as 3 digit hymn numbers within their respective hymnals. 
Examples:
STJ043 - Hymn 43 in Sing the Journey (My faith has found a resting place)
HWB001 - Hymn 1 in Hymnal: a Worship Book (What is this place)
-----

Within each directory, there will be two folders, one for lyrics and one for music sections. 
Example:
STJ043 would contain
STJ043/lyrics
STJ043/music

Lyrics files will be named by verse and stanza.
STJ043/lyrics/2_1.png  - is the second verse, first stanza of Hymn 43 in Sing the Journey
Lyrics which are repeated as part of multiple verses will be listed as 
C_1.png - Chorus - stanza 3



Music sections will be named by stanza and clef.
STJ043/music/1_b.png is the first stanza, bass clef of Hymn 43 in Sing the Journey
