Hymnal Application  

From 2010, an application that I built with a friend for viewing hymns.  It is a cross-platform (iOS and Android) app and was quite fun to build. In particular, trying to build a cross-platform SQLite database layer was an interesting problem that we solved by building a C++ API that could be accessed from either iOS or on Android through the JNI. 

We did not have a chance to release the application because the publisher we were working with didn't have the electronic rights to publish the music.
